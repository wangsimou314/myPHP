<h3>Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) is a W3C Recommendation</h3>
<p>The HTML Media Extensions Working Group published Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) as a W3C Recommendation today. Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME), which extends the ‘HTMLMediaElement’ element of the
HTML specification, is an Application Programming Interface (API) that
allows playback of protected content in Web browsers. Combined with
W3C’s Recommendation Media Source Extensions (MSE) which provides the
API for streaming video, EME is the most common practice today that
allows Web developers to stop using plugins to deliver commercial
quality video over the Web. Please read more in our Press Release.</p>
